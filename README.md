# Environment setup
Git clone the repo 

**Overwrite [this file](hyperparams_and_args.py) so that ``data_dir`` correctly points towards your data directory.**

Implemented using Python3 (3.7) with dependencies specified in requirements.txt, install them in a clean conda environment: <br>
``conda create --name projectx python=3.7`` <br>
``conda activate projectx`` <br>
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

This should be enough for Pycharm, for command line stuff you'll probably need to then also run
``python setup.py install``.
